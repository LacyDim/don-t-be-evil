# How to quit Gmail in 5 minutes

## Step 1: Sign up for an alternative
There are a  lot of options out there. Here is a short run down of some of our
favorites. You will likely have to pay, but hey.com already explains this

All of these can be accessed via the web so you can visit them just like you do
with Gmail, etc.

| Name                                  | On the web? | On your phone? | ðŸ“† Integrated calendar? | ðŸ“‚ Document storage? | Free option? |
|---------------------------------------|-------------|----------------|-------------------------|----------------------|--------------|

| [Hey](https://hey.com)                | âœ…          | âœ…             | ðŸš«                      | ðŸš«                   | ðŸš«           |

Most of these services have their [own guides](https://hey.com/moving-from-gmail/) for helping you migrate which
will be more specific/suited to them. Below is some more general guidelines but
feel free to skip reading if you have already found what you need!


## Step 2: Set up forwarding in Gmail

In Gmail settings, find the tab that says *"Forwarding and POP/IMAP"* (or click
[here](https://mail.google.com/mail/u/2/#settings/fwdandpop). You'll see a
button to *"Add a forwarding address"*. Enter your new email from step 1 and
follow the verification process.

Once the forwarding address is confirmed, go back to
[settings](https://mail.google.com/mail/u/2/#settings/fwdandpop) and select the
option to "Forward a copy.." to your new email address. Here, you'll also be
asked what Gmail should do with email after it's been forwarded.  We suggest
selecting *"delete Gmail's copy"*.  Don't worry, you won't lose any email as
it'll already be showing up in your new inbox. You can always change this
setting later, a lot of folks will want to have Gmail keep forwarded until they
are more comfortable using their new email account.


If you don't want to forward your old email, you don't have to! Some folks will
relish the opportunity to start fresh with a new email address. Gmail isn't
going anywhere and all your old stuff will be there if you ever need it.

## Step 3: Migrate your existing email, contacts, and calendars

Much like step2, this is technically an optional step. If you want to be able to
access your contact list and older emails in your new email account, read on.
If not, skip ahead to Step 4. And as mentioned above, many services have their
own guides and tools for importing your new data. So best to check there first.

You can find all your gmail contacts (here)[https://contacts.google.com/]. On
the sidebar, you'll find an "export" button. The most common/useful format will
likely be vCard, but you can choose whatever works with your new service.

There is no one way to get Getting your existing email messages into your new
account can be a little tricky. We recommend following whatever guide your new
service provides. Of course, you can always download a copy of any (or all) your
Google data [via takeout](https://takeout.google.com). You'll be able to export
your email messages here and if you go this route, we recommend using mbox
format as it's the most common and will be compatible with other software out
there.

Of course, it's always a good idea to keep a backup of these files for your own
records!

## Step 4: That's it! You're done!

At this point, the only thing left to do is to break the habit of typing in
Gmail.com into browser.  Of course, there is a long tail of things you can opt
to do if you really wantto. Most people will find it easier to do these over
time, as they are convenient:

# FAQs
**Q: I don't want to pay for email!**

*A: 1) That's not a question 2) You're already paying for email, the thing that
should scare you is that you don't really know *how* you're paying for it.
Nothing is free. [Hey.com said it best](https://hey.com/pricing/), with gmail,
you are paying with your privacy.*

**Q: Updating my email for all my accounts is annoying! Is there easier way?**

*A: Not that we know of. You'll probably want to update your email for a few
important things like your bank account, credit cards, etc. but you for most
things, it's probably ok if they are using an older email. You can take your
time and chip away at things. It's also a good opportunity to declutter your
email, closing things out that you no longer use.*

**Q: Wait, Apple is big tech too, why are they on the list?**

*A: Apple is a [privacy](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208650) focussed
company, or at least it claims to be. They aren't snooping your emails in order
to show you ads, but I'm sure they are doing it to lock you into their ecosystem
and get you to buy Apple things. The list above is mere suggestion and we
encourage you to do your own research and use your best judgement.*
